# Project Name  A bike-sharing system case study
> Outline a brief description of your project.
   A US bike-sharing company has gathered a large dataset on daily bike demands across the American market based on some factors. It wants to understand the factors on which the demand for these shared bikes depends.


## Table of Contents
* [General Info]
    A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic. The company is finding it very difficult to sustain in the current market scenario. So, it has decided to come up with a mindful business plan to be able to accelerate its revenue as soon as the ongoing lockdown comes to an end, and the economy restores to a healthy state. 


* [Technologies Used] 
    numpy,pandas,sklearn,statsmodel,seaborn,matplotlib,RFE etc
* [Conclusions]
    The three most significant variables affecting the demand for shared bikes are : temp ,yr and Sep
* [Acknowledgements]
    Multiple Linear regression

## General Information
- Provide general information about your project here.
     -Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.

     -How well those variables describe the bike demands.

     -To identify the variables affecting bike count, e.g season, yr,month,holiday etc.

     -To create a linear model that quantitatively relates bike counts(total rental bikes)

     -To know the accuracy of the model, i.e. how well these variables can predict bike counts.

     - What is the background of your project?
        
        BoomBikes aspires to understand the demand for shared bikes among the people after this ongoing quarantine situation ends across the nation due to Covid-19. They have planned this to prepare themselves to cater to the people's needs once the situation gets better all around and stand out from other service providers and make huge profits.

## Conclusions
- Conclusion 1 from the analysis 
    R-squared for training set : 82.3 %
    Adj R-squared for training set: 81.9 %
- Conclusion 2 from the analysis 
    R-squared for test set : 80.6 %
    Adj R-squared for test set: 79.7 %
- Conclusion 3 from the analysis
    The probability distribution of the error has constant variance.
    The errors terms are normally distributed with mean=0
    The error values are statistically independent
- Conclusion 4 from the analysis
    The three most significant variables affecting the demand for shared bikes are : temp ,yr and Sep
